# **Info-Grabber**
A small appliation that allows one to:
* Use regex to extract information from docx files
  * Put that information into a csv
* Extract images from docx files 
  * Images are stored in sequentially named folders


**Disclaimer** ⚠️<br>
The application is specifically taylored to extracting information from Roof Maintenance Solutions Drone Survey Reports and will most likely be ineffective when paired with other docx files.

Also, this is my first "real" project so don't judge me too hard 

**Older Versions** <br>
The application was originally written using tkinter but was moved to PyQt5 because of its slicker UI.
