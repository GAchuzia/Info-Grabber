# **Info-Grabber**
A small appliation that uses regex and pandas to extract specific data from  docx files and put them into a csv. It can also be used to extract images from multiple docx files.


**Older Version(s)** <br>
You can [download](https://github.com/GAchuzia/Info-Grabber/blob/master/old_info-grabber.exe) the old Info-Grabber to see/use the previous version.

**Disclaimer** ‚ö†Ô∏è<br>
The application is specifically taylored to extracting information from Roof Maintenance Solutions Drone Survey Reports and will most likely be ineffective when paired with other docx files.

Also, this is my first "real" project so don't judge my code too hard üòÖ
